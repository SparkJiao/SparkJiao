### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at Nanyang Technological University and the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine reading comprehension and reasoning.

Here are some projects that I lead or contribute to:

- [PFPO](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/PFPO): The source code for our work: Preference Optimization for Reasoning with Pseudo Feedback (ICLR 2025).
- [ProcessDPO](https://github.com/SparkJiao/dpo-trajectory-reasoning): The source code for our EMNLP work with outstanding paper award: Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing.
- [LLMSanitize](https://github.com/ntunlp/LLMSanitize): Our developed tool for detection of data contamination in Large Langauge Models.
- [llama-pipeline-parallel](https://github.com/SparkJiao/llama-pipeline-parallel): A prototype and tutorial for deepspeed pipeline parallel training on Llama.
- [UNK-VQA](https://github.com/guoyang9/UNK-VQA): Our collected dataset for benchmarking the abstention ability of multimodal large models.
- [PandaLLM](https://github.com/dandelionsllm/pandallm): One of the earliest projects exploring continue pre-training of Llama on Chinese corpus.
- [LogicLLM](https://github.com/SparkJiao/LogicLLM): One self-supervised pre-training method to enrich the logic-relevant knowledge of large language models.

Here are some projects for machine reading comprehension and information retrieval in the era of encoder-only pre-trained LMs:

- [MERIt](https://github.com/SparkJiao/MERIt): A self-supervised contrastive learning objective for logical reasoning.
- [LARCH](https://github.com/SparkJiao/LARCH): Conversational image search.
- [REPT](https://github.com/SparkJiao/Retrieval-based-Pre-training-for-Machine-Reading-Comprehension): Retrieval-based pre-training for machine reading comprehension.
- [STM](https://github.com/SparkJiao/Self-Training-MRC): A Self-Training Method for Machine Reading Comprehension with Soft Evidence Extraction.
